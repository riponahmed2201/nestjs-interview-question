# NestJS Interview Question

## 1) What is NestJS, and why is it popular for building Node.js applications?

  - NestJS is a framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications. It is built on top of Node.js and is written in TypeScript. Its popularity stems from its modular architecture, ease of testing, and strong support for TypeScript, along with its utilization of Decorators for succinct and maintainable code.

## 2) Can you explain the key features of NestJS?

`Some key features of NestJS include:`
- Modular Structure: NestJS promotes a modular structure, helping to organize code in a clear and maintainable way.
- Dependency Injection: It has a robust Dependency Injection container that promotes code modularity and testability.
- Decorators: Decorators: NestJS utilizes decorators for adding metadata and additional behavior to classes, methods, and properties.
- Middleware, Guards, Interceptors, and Pipes: These classes help to handle different aspects of the request-response cycle.
- Microservices Support: NestJS has built-in support for microservice architecture.
- Integration with Other Libraries: It provides a level of abstraction over libraries like Express or Fastify, making integration easier.

## 3) What is the main difference between NestJS and Express.js?
  - Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. On the other hand, NestJS is a more opinionated framework built on top of Express.js (or Fastify) that provides a high-level abstraction with a lot of built-in decorators and modules, making it easier to organize and scale large applications. NestJS also has a strong emphasis on TypeScript, which is not inherent in Express.js.
